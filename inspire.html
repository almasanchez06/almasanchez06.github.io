        <p>A hero is someone that we look up to. Heroes embody what we truly value most. Therefore who we select as role models says a lot about who we are as people.</p>
        <p>Selena Gomez is a big role model to me. Selena is an active advocacy for the Lupus community. I also struggle with Lupus so it is inspiring to see someone famous advocating for such an underrated and misunderstood autoimmune disorder.</p>

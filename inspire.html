        <h1>Selena Gomez</h1>
        <h2>What makes a hero???????????</h2>
        <p>A hero is someone that we look up to. Heroes embody what we truly value most. Therefore who we select as role models says a lot about who we are as people.</p>
        <p>Selena is my inspiration. Selena is an active member and advocator for the Lupus community. I also suffer from Lupus, so it is nice to see a famous person advocating for an under looked autoimmune disease.</p>
